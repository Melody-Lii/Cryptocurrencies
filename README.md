# Cryptocurrencies

## Project Overview

This analysis provides a summary of various cryptocurrencies for the client, Accountability Accounting conducting using unsupervised machine learning.
The goal of the analysis was to select out from the dataset the cryptocurrencies considered viable according to set criteria and then to classify the currencies.

## Summary
The challenge first involved cleaning data from the crypto_data.csv file in order to ensure that both the currencies were worth consideration and that the data could be processed by the machine learning tools.

So we removed columns that were redundand and labels,created dummy variables for categorical data.

After the dimensions had been reduced, the machine learning algorithm could be put into effect. The primary goal of this project was to classify the different cryptocurrencies.

Then Plotting the inertia against the numnber of clusters (K) revealed the "elbow" on the Elbow Curve to be at four clusters. 

Please see those figures and plots in ./images folder.
